### Methods

#### Data download and preprocessing

To generate binary mutated/non-mutated gene labels for our machine learning model, we used mutation calls for TCGA Pan-Cancer Atlas samples from MC3 [@doi:10.1016/j.cels.2018.03.002] and copy number threshold calls from GISTIC2.0 [@doi:10.1186/gb-2011-12-4-r41].
MC3 mutation calls were downloaded from the Genomic Data Commons (GDC) of the National Cancer Institute, at <https://gdc.cancer.gov/about-data/publications/pancanatlas>.
Thresholded copy number calls are from an older version of the GDC data and are available here: <https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/TCGA_PanCanAtlas_Copy_Number_Data/6144122>.
We removed hypermutated samples, defined as two or more standard deviations above the mean non-silent somatic mutation count, from our dataset to reduce the number of false positives (i.e., non-driver mutations).
Any sample with either a non-silent somatic variant or a copy number variation (copy number gain in the target gene for oncogenes and copy number loss in the target gene for tumor suppressor genes) was included in the positive set; all remaining samples were considered negative for mutation in the target gene.

RNA sequencing data for TCGA was downloaded from GDC at the same link provided above for the Pan-Cancer Atlas.
We discarded non-protein-coding genes and genes that failed to map and removed tumors that were measured from multiple sites.
After filtering to remove hypermutated samples and taking the intersection of samples with both mutation and gene expression data, 9074 total TCGA samples remained.

#### Cancer gene set construction

In order to study mutation status classification for a diverse set of cancer driver genes, we started with the set of 125 frequently altered genes from Vogelstein et al. [@doi:10.1126/science.1235122] (all genes from Table S2A).
For each target gene, in order to ensure that the training dataset was reasonably balanced (i.e., that there would be enough mutated samples to train an effective classifier), we included only cancer types with at least 15 mutated samples and at least 5% mutated samples, which we refer to here as "valid" cancer types.
In some cases, this resulted in genes with no valid cancer types, which we dropped from the analysis.
Out of the 125 genes originally listed in the Vogelstein et al. cancer gene set, we retained 84 target genes after filtering for valid cancer types.

#### Classifier setup and optimizer comparison details

We trained logistic regression classifiers to predict whether or not a given sample had a mutational event in a given target gene using gene expression features as explanatory variables.
Based on our previous work, gene expression is generally effective for this problem across many target genes, although other -omics types can be equally effective in many cases [@doi:10.1186/s13059-022-02705-y].
Our model was trained on gene expression data (X) to predict mutation presence or absence (y) in a target gene.
To control for varying mutation burden per sample and to adjust for potential cancer type-specific expression patterns, we included one-hot encoded cancer type and log~10~(sample mutation count) in the model as covariates.
Since gene expression datasets tend to have many dimensions and comparatively few samples, we used a LASSO penalty to perform feature selection [@doi:10.1111/j.2517-6161.1996.tb02080.x].
LASSO logistic regression has the advantage of generating sparse models (some or most coefficients are 0), as well as having a single tunable hyperparameter which can be easily interpreted as an indicator of regularization strength, or model complexity.

To compare model selection across optimizers, we first split the "valid" cancer types into train (75%) and test (25%) sets.
We then split the training data into "subtrain" (66% of the training set) data to train the model on, and "holdout" (33% of the training set) data to perform model selection, i.e. to use to select the best-performing regularization parameter, and the best-performing learning rate for SGD in the cases where multiple learning rates were considered.
In each case, these splits were stratified by cancer type, i.e. each split had as close as possible to equal proportions of each cancer type included in the dataset for the given driver gene.

#### LASSO parameter range selection and comparison between optimizers

The scikit-learn implementations of coordinate descent (in `liblinear`/`LogisticRegression`) and stochastic gradient descent (in `SGDClassifier`) use slightly different parameterizations of the LASSO regularization strength parameter. `liblinear`'s logistic regression solver optimizes the following loss function:

$$\hat{w} = \text{argmin}_{w} \ (C \cdot \ell(X, y; w)) + ||w||_1$$

where $\ell(X, y; w)$ denotes the negative log-likelihood of the observed data $(X, y)$ given a particular choice of feature weights $w$.`SGDClassifier` optimizes the following loss function:

$$\hat{w} = \text{argmin}_{w} \ \ell(X, y; w) + \alpha ||w||_1$$

<!--_ -->

which is equivalent with the exception of the LASSO parameter which is formulated slightly differently, as $\alpha = \frac{1}{C}$.
The result of this slight difference in parameterization is that `liblinear` $C$ values vary inversely with regularization strength (higher values = less regularization, or greater model complexity) and `SGDClassifier` $\alpha$ values vary directly with regularization strength (lower values = less regularization, or greater model complexity).

For the `liblinear` optimizer, we trained models using $C$ values evenly spaced on a logarithmic scale between (10^-3^, 10^7^); i.e. the output of `numpy.logspace(-3, 7, 21)`.
For the SGD optimizer, we trained models using the inverse range of $\alpha$ values between (10^-7^, 10^3^), or `numpy.logspace(-7, 3, 21)`.
These hyperparameter ranges were intended to give evenly distributed coverage across genes that included "underfit" models (predicting only the mean or using very few features, poor performance on all datasets), "overfit" models (performing perfectly on training data but comparatively poorly on cross-validation and test data), and a wide variety of models in between that typically included the best fits to the cross-validation and test data.

For ease of visual comparison in our figures, we plot the SGD $\alpha$ parameter directly, and the `liblinear` $C$ parameter inversely (i.e. $\frac{1}{C}$).
This orients the x-axes of the relevant plots in the same direction: lower values represent lower regularization strength or higher model complexity, and higher values represent higher regularization strength or lower model complexity, for both optimizers.

#### SGD learning rate selection

scikit-learn's `SGDClassifier` provides four built-in approaches to learning rate scheduling: `constant` (a single, constant learning rate), `optimal` (a learning rate with an initial value selected using a heuristic based on the regularization parameter and the data loss, that decreases across epochs), `invscaling` (a learning rate that decreases exponentially by epoch), and `adaptive` (a learning rate that starts at a constant value, which is divided by 5 each time the training loss fails to decrease for 5 straight epochs).
The `optimal` learning rate schedule is used by default.

When we compared these four approaches, we used a constant learning rate of 0.0005, and an initial learning rate of 0.1 for the `adaptive` and `invscaling` schedules.
We also tested a fifth approach that we called "`constant_search`", in which we tested a range of constant learning rates in a grid search on a validation dataset, then evaluated the model on the test data using the best-performing constant learning rate by validation AUPR.
For the grid search, we used the following range of constant learning rates: {0.000005, 0.00001, 0.00005, 0.0001, 0.0005, 0.001, 0.01}.
Unless otherwise specified, results for SGD in the main paper figures used the `constant_search` approach, which performed the best in our comparison between schedulers.
