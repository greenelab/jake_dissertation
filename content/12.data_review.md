## Cancer -omics data and applications

### Publicly available cancer -omics data resources

TCGA/ICGC, CCLE, DepMap/Pediatric DepMap, CMap/LINCS, GDSC/PRISM, PCAWG, AACR Genie, PDX Encyclopedia?, others?
    - separate into human sample datasets (TCGA, ICGC, PCAWG, AACR) and cell line/model system datasets

### Applications of machine learning in cancer genomics

Cancer type/subtype prediction
    - As a toy problem for method development, or as CUP prediction which is clinically relevant

Driver gene prediction

Mutation status/MSI/DDR/synthetic lethality prediction (can probably lump these all together)

Survival/prognosis prediction, patient stratification

Drug response prediction
    - CCLE papers
    - Immunotherapy papers (some in clinical cohorts)

Metastasis/metastatic potential prediction

Others?
