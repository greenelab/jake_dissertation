## Chapter 1: Background

This chapter was formatted for this dissertation to provide background information and context for the following chapters. Some elements of the second subsection on machine learning modeling techniques were previously published in the _Current Opinion in Biotechnology_ journal as "Incorporating biological structure into machine learning models in biomedicine" (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.copbio.2019.12.021).

**Contributions:**
For the unpublished parts of this chapter, I was the sole author.
For the published parts of this chapter, I wrote the original draft of the review paper, which was edited based on feedback from Casey S. Greene and anonymous reviewers.
