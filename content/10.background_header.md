## Chapter 1: background

This chapter was formatted for this dissertation to provide background information and context for the following chapters. The subsection titled "Machine learning modeling strategies for high-dimensional -omics data" was adapted from a review paper previously published in the _Current Opinion in Biotechnology_ journal, as "Incorporating biological structure into machine learning models in biomedicine" (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.copbio.2019.12.021).

**Contributions:**
For the unpublished parts of this chapter, I was the sole author.
For the published parts of this chapter, I wrote the original draft of the review paper, which was edited based on feedback from Casey S. Greene and anonymous reviewers.
