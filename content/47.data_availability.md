### Data and code availability

The data from TCGA analyzed during this study were previously published as part of the TCGA Pan-Cancer Atlas project [@doi:10.1038/ng.2764], and are available from the NIH NCI Genomic Data Commons (GDC).
The data from CCLE analyzed during this study were previously published [@doi:10.1038/s41586-019-1186-3], and are available from the Broad Institute's DepMap Portal.
Raw classification results, performance figures for all genes in the Vogelstein et al. 2013 dataset, and parameter selection results and performance comparisons for each individual gene in the "best vs. smallest good" analyses are available on Figshare at <https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.23826450>, under a CC0 license.
The scripts used to download and preprocess the datasets for this study are available at <https://github.com/greenelab/pancancer-evaluation/tree/master/00_process_data>.
Scripts for TCGA <-> CCLE comparisons (Figures 2 and 3) and neural network experiments (Figure 5) are available in the <https://github.com/greenelab/pancancer-evaluation/tree/master/08_cell_line_prediction> directory.
Scripts for TCGA cancer type comparisons (Figure 4) are available in the <https://github.com/greenelab/pancancer-evaluation/tree/master/02_cancer_type_classification> directory.
All scripts are available under the open-source BSD 3-clause license.
