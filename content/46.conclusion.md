## Conclusion

Without directly evaluating model generalization, it is tempting to assume that simpler models will generalize better than more complex ones, and previous studies and sets of guidelines suggest this rule of thumb [@doi:10.1214/088342306000000060; @doi:10/bhfhgd; @doi:10.4137/CIN.S408; @doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004961].
However, we do not observe strong evidence that simpler models inherently generalize more effectively than more complex ones.
There may be other reasons to train small models or to look for the best model of a certain size/sparsity, such as biomarker interpretability or assay cost.
Our results underscore the importance of defining clear goals for each analysis.
If the goal is to achieve generalization across contexts or datasets, whenever possible we recommend directly evaluating generalization.
When it is not feasible, we recommend choosing the model that performs the best on unseen data via cross-validation or a holdout dataset.
