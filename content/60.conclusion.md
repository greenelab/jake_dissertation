## Chapter 5: future directions

**Contributions:**
I wrote this chapter for the purpose of this dissertation.

### Introduction

In this dissertation, we have identified complexities of the structure of large cancer -omics datasets that make building predictive models less straightforward than on more uniform datasets often considered in large-scale machine learning applications.
The results of Chapter 2 show that model selection depends heavily on which optimizer is used to fit the model, even when relying on a fairly simple linear modeling strategy, logistic regression.
In Chapter 3, we saw that although different -omics types in TCGA may have slightly variable information content related to cancer function, much of it is redundant in the sense that combining -omics layers generally does not result in a large performance boost.
Our experiments in Chapter 4 showed that generalization across cancer types and model systems can vary highly based on the held-out biological context, and that smaller or simpler models do not in general tend to be more robust across contexts than models that optimize cross-validation performance within a biological context.
Taken together, these results suggest several threads of future directions, both focused on development of methods and datasets, and focused on downstream biological/clinical applications.

### Multi-omics integration

In chapter 2, we saw the somewhat counterintuitive result that when gene expression and DNA methylation readouts were combined, they failed to predict mutations in 6 key pan-cancer driver genes better than expression or methylation data alone.
We also noted in the discussion section of chapter 2 that the multi-omics integration method we tried was a fairly simple one: we combined the feature sets of each -omics type and fit a model directly to this larger dataset, sometimes referred to as "early" integration.
A wide variety of more complex methods for data integration exist and have been applied successfully to multi-omics integration problems, reviewed in detail in [@doi:10.1016/j.inffus.2018.09.012; @doi:10.1016/j.csbj.2021.06.030] and others.

Multi-omics integration is a particularly salient problem in single-cell analysis, where data are generally sparse and often unpaired, or measured on different cells (reviewed in [@doi:10.1038/s41581-021-00463-x; @doi:10.1016/j.csbj.2021.04.060; @doi:10.1016/j.tig.2021.08.012] and elsewhere).
However, many existing methods are not designed to incorporate axes of variation other than those typically included in single-cell studies, such as mutation status or cancer type, although some incorporate supervision or prior knowledge (e.g. [@arxiv:2102.03014; @arxiv:2307.10093; @doi:10.1038/s42256-022-00545-w]).
More specific characterization of the conditions under which integrating multiple -omics types provides additional information relative to some labeling, as well as identifying conditions when -omics types are functionally redundant, would have important implications for study design.

### Cancer model systems and data

We showed in chapter 4 that when mutation prediction models are trained on cell line data, performance on tumor samples is generally worse than performance on held out cell lines.
We also saw that the converse is not true: on balance, models trained on tumor samples tend to generalize relatively well to cell lines.
This is likely at least in part due to biological differences between cancer cell lines and the tumors they aim to model.
Other studies have also observed that cell line gene expression is less representative of tumor samples than PDX mouse models [@doi:10.1101/2023.04.11.536431] and genetically engineered mouse models [@doi:10.1186/s13073-021-00888-w], although this can vary by cancer type.
In Chapter 2, we noted the general reliance of drug response prediction efforts on public cell line datasets such as CCLE and GDSC, most likely due to the size (both in terms of sample size and number of -omics data types profiled) and accessibility of the datasets.
Together with our results, this underscores the need for larger and more representative compendia of model system data that may be biologically closer to human tumors, including mouse models, tumoroids, and others.

### Mutation prediction for subgroup identification in clinical trials

- Using mutation prediction models to define patient subgroups, e.g. for clinical trials
    - Other units of "mutation" prediction (e.g. Ras pathway, etc)
    - Challenge with prospective vs. retrospective evaluation (hard to know what didn't work,
      or what would have worked in a clinical trial that was already run i.e. hard to observe
      counterfactuals)
        - Causal inference methods could help here
