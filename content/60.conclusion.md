### Cancer model systems and data

We saw in chapter 4 that when mutation prediction models are trained on cell line data, performance on tumor samples is generally worse than performance on held out cell lines.
We also saw that the converse is not true: on balance, models trained on tumor samples tend to generalize relatively well to cell lines.
This is likely at least in part due to biological differences between cancer cell lines and the tumors they aim to model.
Other studies have also observed that cell line gene expression is less representative of tumor samples than PDX mouse models [@doi:10.1101/2023.04.11.536431] and genetically engineered mouse models [@doi:10.1186/s13073-021-00888-w], although this can vary by cancer type.
In Chapter 2, we noted the general reliance of drug response prediction efforts on public cell line datasets such as CCLE and GDSC, most likely due to the size (both in terms of sample size and number of -omics data types profiled) and accessibility of the datasets.
Together with our results, this underscores the need for larger and more representative compendia of model system data that may be closer to human tumors, including mouse models, tumoroids, and others.

### Multi-omics integration

- Wide world of approaches to multi-omics integration
- Better ways to tease out where multiple views are redundant, and where they can contribute uniquely
  (ideally conditioned on a label e.g. mutation status, cancer type, etc)

### Mutation prediction for subgroup identification in clinical trials

- Using mutation prediction models to define patient subgroups, e.g. for clinical trials
    - Other units of "mutation" prediction (e.g. Ras pathway, etc)
    - Challenge with prospective vs. retrospective evaluation (hard to know what didn't work,
      or what would have worked in a clinical trial that was already run i.e. hard to observe
      counterfactuals)
        - Causal inference methods could help here
