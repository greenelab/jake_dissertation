    "abstract": "  We introduce Adam, an algorithm for first-order gradient-based optimization of stochastic objective functions, based on adaptive estimates of lower-order moments. The method is straightforward to implement, is computationally efficient, has little memory requirements, is invariant to diagonal rescaling of the gradients, and is well suited for problems that are large in terms of data and/or parameters. The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods. Finally, we discuss AdaMax, a variant of Adam based on the infinity norm. ",

    "abstract": "  Despite their massive size, successful deep artificial neural networks can exhibit a remarkably small difference between training and test performance. Conventional wisdom attributes small generalization error either to properties of the model family, or to the regularization techniques used during training.\n  Through extensive systematic experiments, we show how these traditional approaches fail to explain why large neural networks generalize well in practice. Specifically, our experiments establish that state-of-the-art convolutional networks for image classification trained with stochastic gradient methods easily fit a random labeling of the training data. This phenomenon is qualitatively unaffected by explicit regularization, and occurs even if we replace the true images by completely unstructured random noise. We corroborate these experimental findings with a theoretical construction showing that simple depth two neural networks already have perfect finite sample expressivity as soon as the number of parameters exceeds the number of data points as it usually does in practice.\n  We interpret our experimental findings by comparison with traditional models.

We emphasize that every aspect of PyTorch is a regular Python program under the full control of its user.

    "abstract": "  The notion of implicit bias, or implicit regularization, has been suggested as a means to explain the surprising generalization ability of modern-days overparameterized learning algorithms. This notion refers to the tendency of the optimization algorithm towards a certain structured solution that often generalizes well. Recently, several papers have studied implicit regularization and were able to identify this phenomenon in various scenarios. We revisit this paradigm in arguably the simplest non-trivial setup, and study the implicit bias of Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) in the context of Stochastic Convex Optimization. As a first step, we provide a simple construction that rules out the existence of a \\emph{distribution-independent} implicit regularizer that governs the generalization ability of SGD. We then demonstrate a learning problem that rules out a very general class of \\emph{distribution-dependent} implicit regularizers from explaining generalization, which includes strongly convex regularizers as well as non-degenerate norm-based regularizations. Certain aspects of our constructions point out to significant difficulties in providing a comprehensive explanation of an algorithm's generalization performance by solely arguing about its implicit regularization properties.

Analysis of ROC and PR, however, often gives misleading and inflated performance evaluations, especially with an imbalanced ground truth. Here, we demonstrate the problems with ROC and PR analysis through simulations, and propose the MCC-F1 curve to address these drawbacks. The MCC-F1 curve combines two informative single-threshold metrics, MCC and the F1 score. The MCC-F1 curve more clearly differentiates good and bad classifiers, even with imbalanced ground truths. We also introduce the MCC-F1 metric, which provides a single value that integrates many aspects of classifier performance across the whole range of classification thresholds. Finally, we provide an R package that plots MCC-F1 curves and calculates related metrics. ",

In this work, we seek to understand these issues in the simpler setting of linear regression (including both underparameterized and overparameterized regimes), where our goal is to make sharp instance-based comparisons of the implicit regularization afforded by (unregularized) average SGD with the explicit regularization of ridge regression. For a broad class of least squares problem instances (that are natural in high-dimensional settings), we show: (1) for every problem instance and for every ridge parameter, (unregularized) SGD, when provided with logarithmically more samples than that provided to the ridge algorithm, generalizes no worse than the ridge solution (provided SGD uses a tuned constant stepsize); (2) conversely, there exist instances (in this wide problem class) where optimally-tuned ridge regression requires quadratically more samples than SGD in order to have the same generalization performance. Taken together, our results show that, up to the logarithmic factors, the generalization performance of SGD is always no worse than that of ridge regression in a wide range of overparameterized problems, and, in fact, could be much better for some problem instances. More generally, our results show how algorithmic regularization has important consequences even in simpler (overparameterized) convex settings. ",

    "abstract": "  Genomic (DNA) sequences encode an enormous amount of information for gene regulation and protein synthesis. Similar to natural language models, researchers have proposed foundation models in genomics to learn generalizable features from unlabeled genome data that can then be fine-tuned for downstream tasks such as identifying regulatory elements. Due to the quadratic scaling of attention, previous Transformer-based genomic models have used 512 to 4k tokens as context (<0.001% of the human genome), significantly limiting the modeling of long-range interactions in DNA. In addition, these methods rely on tokenizers to aggregate meaningful DNA units, losing single nucleotide resolution where subtle genetic variations can completely alter protein function via single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Recently, Hyena, a large language model based on implicit convolutions was shown to match attention in quality while allowing longer context lengths and lower time complexity. Leveraging Hyenas new long-range capabilities, we present HyenaDNA, a genomic foundation model pretrained on the human reference genome with context lengths of up to 1 million tokens at the single nucleotide-level, an up to 500x increase over previous dense attention-based models. HyenaDNA scales sub-quadratically in sequence length (training up to 160x faster than Transformer), uses single nucleotide tokens, and has full global context at each layer. We explore what longer context enables - including the first use of in-context learning in genomics for simple adaptation to novel tasks without updating pretrained model weights. On fine-tuned benchmarks from the Nucleotide Transformer, HyenaDNA reaches state-of-the-art (SotA) on 12 of 17 datasets using a model with orders of magnitude less parameters and pretraining data. On the GenomicBenchmarks, HyenaDNA surpasses SotA on all 8 datasets on average by +9 accuracy points. ",

To examine this potential, here we evaluate the ability of state-of-the-art sequence analysis methods to specifically recover known cancer genes. While some cancer genes are identified by analysis of recurrence, spatial clustering or predicted impact of somatic mutations, many remain undetected due to lack of power to discriminate driver mutations from the background mutational load (13–60% recall of cancer genes impacted by somatic single-nucleotide variants, depending on the method). Cancer genes not detected by mutation recurrence also tend to be missed by all types of exome analysis. Nonetheless, these genes are implicated by other experiments such as functional genetic screens and expression profiling. These challenges are only partially addressed by increasing sample size and will likely hold even as greater numbers of tumours are analysed.</jats:p>",

Analysis of <jats:italic>trans</jats:italic>-effects of mutations and copy number alterations with xseq identifies mutations in 150 genes impacting expression networks, with 89 novel predictions. We reveal two important novel characteristics of mutation impact on expression: (1) patients harbouring known driver mutations exhibit different downstream gene expression consequences; (2) expression patterns for some mutations are stable across tumour types. These results have critical implications for identification and interpretation of mutations with consequent impact on transcription in cancer.</jats:p>",

Existing methods, however, either lack explicit statistical models, or use models based on simplistic assumptions. Here, we present driverMAPS (Model-based Analysis of Positive Selection), a model-based approach to driver gene identification. This method explicitly models positive selection at the single-base level, as well as highly heterogeneous background mutational processes. In particular, the selection model captures elevated mutation rates in functionally important sites using multiple external annotations, and spatial clustering of mutations. Simulations under realistic evolutionary models demonstrate the increased power of driverMAPS over current approaches. Applying driverMAPS to TCGA data of 20 tumor types, we identified 159 new potential driver genes, including the mRNA methyltransferase METTL3-METTL14. We experimentally validated METTL3 as a tumor suppressor gene in bladder cancer, providing support to the important role mRNA modification plays in tumorigenesis.</jats:p>",

Here we present a comprehensive pan-cancer analysis utilizing transcriptomic profiles from The Cancer Genome Atlas and the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia to evaluate cell lines as models of primary tumors across 22 tumor types. We perform correlation analysis and gene set enrichment analysis to understand the differences between cell lines and primary tumors. Additionally, we classify cell lines into tumor subtypes in 9 tumor types. We present our pancreatic cancer results as a case study and find that the commonly used cell line MIA PaCa-2 is transcriptionally unrepresentative of primary pancreatic adenocarcinomas. Lastly, we propose a new cell line panel, the TCGA-110-CL, for pan-cancer studies. This study provides a resource to help researchers select more representative cell line models.</jats:p>",

However, other molecular perturbations can “phenocopy” pathogenic mutations, but would not be identified using standard clinical sequencing, leading to missed opportunities for other patients to benefit from targeted treatments. We hypothesized that RNA phenocopy signatures of key cancer driver gene mutations could improve our ability to predict response to targeted therapies, despite not being directly trained on drug response. To test this, we built gene expression signatures in tissue samples for specific mutations and found that phenocopy signatures broadly increased accuracy of drug response predictions in-vitro compared to DNA mutation alone, and identified additional cancer cell lines that respond well with a positive/negative predictive value on par or better than DNA mutations. We further validated our results across four clinical cohorts. Our results suggest that routine RNA sequencing of tumors to identify phenocopies in addition to standard targeted DNA sequencing would improve our ability to accurately select patients for targeted therapies in the clinic.</jats:p>",

Here we develop methods to group, classify and describe somatic structural variants, using data from the Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes (PCAWG) Consortium of the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), which aggregated whole-genome sequencing data from 2,658 cancers across 38 tumour types<jats:sup>8</jats:sup>. Sixteen signatures of structural variation emerged. Deletions have a multimodal size distribution, assort unevenly across tumour types and patients, are enriched in late-replicating regions and correlate with inversions. Tandem duplications also have a multimodal size distribution, but are enriched in early-replicating regions—as are unbalanced translocations. Replication-based mechanisms of rearrangement generate varied chromosomal structures with low-level copy-number gains and frequent inverted rearrangements. One prominent structure consists of 2–7 templates copied from distinct regions of the genome strung together within one locus. Such cycles of templated insertions correlate with tandem duplications, and—in liver cancer—frequently activate the telomerase gene <jats:italic>TERT</jats:italic>. A wide variety of rearrangement processes are active in cancer, which generate complex configurations of the genome upon which selection can act.</jats:p>",

Here, as part of the Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes (PCAWG) Consortium<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> of the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), we characterized mutational signatures using 84,729,690 somatic mutations from 4,645 whole-genome and 19,184 exome sequences that encompass most types of cancer. We identified 49 single-base-substitution, 11 doublet-base-substitution, 4 clustered-base-substitution and 17 small insertion-and-deletion signatures. The substantial size of our dataset, compared with previous analyses<jats:sup>3–15</jats:sup>, enabled the discovery of new signatures, the separation of overlapping signatures and the decomposition of signatures into components that may represent associated—but distinct—DNA damage, repair and/or replication mechanisms. By estimating the contribution of each signature to the mutational catalogues of individual cancer genomes, we revealed associations of signatures to exogenous or endogenous exposures, as well as to defective DNA-maintenance processes. However, many signatures are of unknown cause. This analysis provides a systematic perspective on the repertoire of mutational processes that contribute to the development of human cancer.</jats:p>",

Key to this effort has been development of computational algorithms to find genes that drive cancer based on their patterns of mutation in large patient cohorts. Because there is no generally accepted gold standard of driver genes, it has been difficult to quantitatively compare these methods. We present a machine-learning–based method for driver gene prediction and a protocol to evaluate and compare prediction methods. Our results suggest that most current methods do not adequately account for heterogeneity in the number of mutations expected by chance and consequently yield many false-positive calls, particularly in cancers with high mutation rate.</jats:p>",

Motivated by this phenomenon, we consider when a perfect fit to training data in linear regression is compatible with accurate prediction. We give a characterization of linear regression problems for which the minimum norm interpolating prediction rule has near-optimal prediction accuracy. The characterization is in terms of two notions of the effective rank of the data covariance. It shows that overparameterization is essential for benign overfitting in this setting: the number of directions in parameter space that are unimportant for prediction must significantly exceed the sample size. By studying examples of data covariance properties that this characterization shows are required for benign overfitting, we find an important role for finite-dimensional data: the accuracy of the minimum norm interpolating prediction rule approaches the best possible accuracy for a much narrower range of properties of the data distribution when the data lie in an infinite-dimensional space vs. when the data lie in a finite-dimensional space with dimension that grows faster than the sample size.</jats:p>",

Unfortunately, the translation of cell line–derived biomarkers often fails. To bridge this gap between model systems and clinical practice, we developed a mathematical framework to capture gene expression patterns shared between model systems and human tumors in a consensus space. In this space, we trained drug response predictors on a panel of 1,000 cell lines and successfully predicted drug response on approximately 1,300 human tumors. Finally, we derived an approach to interpret the predictors, and we propose potential mechanisms mediating the cytotoxic effects of two drugs. Experimental validation is required to confirm these results.</jats:p>",

A recent attempt based on machine learning has been proposed for classifying aberrant pathway activity from multiomic cancer data. However, we note several critical limitations there, such as high-dimensionality, data sparsity and model performance. Given the central importance and broad impact of precision oncology, we propose nature-inspired deep Ras activation pan-cancer (NatDRAP), a deep neural network (DNN) model, to address those restrictions for the identification of hidden responders. In this study, we develop the nature-inspired deep learning model that integrates bulk RNA sequencing, copy number and mutation data from PanCanAltas to detect pan-cancer Ras pathway activation. In NatDRAP, we propose to synergize the nature-inspired artificial bee colony algorithm with different gradient-based optimizers in one framework for optimizing DNNs in a collaborative manner. Multiple experiments were conducted on 33 different cancer types across PanCanAtlas. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed NatDRAP can provide superior performance over other benchmark methods with strong robustness towards diagnosing RAS aberrant pathway activity across different cancer types. In addition, gene ontology enrichment and pathological analysis are conducted to reveal novel insights into the RAS aberrant pathway activity identification and characterization. NatDRAP is written in Python and available at https://github.com/lixt314/NatDRAP1.</jats:p>",

Key to addressing this challenge are computational methods, such as supervised learning and label propagation, that can leverage molecular interaction networks to predict gene attributes. In spite of being a popular machine-learning technique across fields, supervised learning has been applied only in a few network-based studies for predicting pathway-, phenotype- or disease-associated genes. It is unknown how supervised learning broadly performs across different networks and diverse gene classification tasks, and how it compares to label propagation, the widely benchmarked canonical approach for this problem.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Results</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>In this study, we present a comprehensive benchmarking of supervised learning for network-based gene classification, evaluating this approach and a classic label propagation technique on hundreds of diverse prediction tasks and multiple networks using stringent evaluation schemes. We demonstrate that supervised learning on a gene’s full network connectivity outperforms label propagaton and achieves high prediction accuracy by efficiently capturing local network properties, rivaling label propagation’s appeal for naturally using network topology. We further show that supervised learning on the full network is also superior to learning on node embeddings (derived using node2vec), an increasingly popular approach for concisely representing network connectivity. These results show that supervised learning is an accurate approach for prioritizing genes associated with diverse functions, diseases and traits and should be considered a staple of network-based gene classification workflows.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Availability and implementation</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>The datasets and the code used to reproduce the results and add new gene classification methods have been made freely available.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Contact</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>arjun@msu.edu</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Supplementary information</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>",

However, a difficulty associated with these beadarrays is that probes come in two different designs, characterized by widely different DNA methylation distributions and dynamic range, which may bias downstream analyses. A key statistical issue is therefore how best to adjust for the two different probe designs.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Results: Here we propose a novel model-based intra-array normalization strategy for 450 k data, called BMIQ (Beta MIxture Quantile dilation), to adjust the beta-values of type2 design probes into a statistical distribution characteristic of type1 probes. The strategy involves application of a three-state beta-mixture model to assign probes to methylation states, subsequent transformation of probabilities into quantiles and finally a methylation-dependent dilation transformation to preserve the monotonicity and continuity of the data. We validate our method on cell-line data, fresh frozen and paraffin-embedded tumour tissue samples and demonstrate that BMIQ compares favourably with two competing methods. Specifically, we show that BMIQ improves the robustness of the normalization procedure, reduces the technical variation and bias of type2 probe values and successfully eliminates the type1 enrichment bias caused by the lower dynamic range of type2 probes.

Experimental functional characterization of these proteins is time-consuming and expensive, and is often only done rigorously for few selected model organisms. Computational function prediction approaches have been suggested to fill this gap. The functions of proteins are classified using the Gene Ontology (GO), which contains over 40 000 classes. Additionally, proteins have multiple functions, making function prediction a large-scale, multi-class, multi-label problem.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Results</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>We have developed a novel method to predict protein function from sequence. We use deep learning to learn features from protein sequences as well as a cross-species protein–protein interaction network. Our approach specifically outputs information in the structure of the GO and utilizes the dependencies between GO classes as background information to construct a deep learning model. We evaluate our method using the standards established by the Computational Assessment of Function Annotation (CAFA) and demonstrate a significant improvement over baseline methods such as BLAST, in particular for predicting cellular locations.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Availability and implementation</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>Web server: http://deepgo.bio2vec.net, Source code: https://github.com/bio-ontology-research-group/deepgo</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Supplementary information</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>",

Recent evidence suggests that integrating additional omics can improve the prediction accuracy which raises the question of how to integrate the additional omics. Regardless of the integration strategy, clinical utility and translatability are crucial. Thus, we reasoned a multi-omics approach combined with clinical datasets would improve drug response prediction and clinical relevance.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Results</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>We propose MOLI, a multi-omics late integration method based on deep neural networks. MOLI takes somatic mutation, copy number aberration and gene expression data as input, and integrates them for drug response prediction. MOLI uses type-specific encoding sub-networks to learn features for each omics type, concatenates them into one representation and optimizes this representation via a combined cost function consisting of a triplet loss and a binary cross-entropy loss. The former makes the representations of responder samples more similar to each other and different from the non-responders, and the latter makes this representation predictive of the response values. We validate MOLI on in vitro and in vivo datasets for five chemotherapy agents and two targeted therapeutics. Compared to state-of-the-art single-omics and early integration multi-omics methods, MOLI achieves higher prediction accuracy in external validations. Moreover, a significant improvement in MOLI’s performance is observed for targeted drugs when training on a pan-drug input, i.e. using all the drugs with the same target compared to training only on drug-specific inputs. MOLI’s high predictive power suggests it may have utility in precision oncology.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Availability and implementation</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>https://github.com/hosseinshn/MOLI.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Supplementary information</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>",

We find that expression consistently outperforms DNA for predicting vulnerabilities, including many currently stratified by canonical DNA markers.

They account for ≥70% expression heritability and could therefore facilitate uncovering mechansisms underlying the origination of complex diseases. However, unlike cis-eQTLs, identifying trans-eQTLs is challenging because of small effect sizes, tissue-specificity, and the severe multiple-testing burden. Trans-eQTLs affect multiple target genes, but aggregating evidence over individual SNP-gene associations is hampered by strong gene expression correlations resulting in correlated p-values. Our method Tejaas predicts trans-eQTLs by performing L<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>-regularized ‘reverse’ multiple regression of each SNP on all genes, aggregating evidence from many small trans-effects while being unaffected by the strong expression correlations. Combined with a novel non-linear, unsupervised k-nearest-neighbor method to remove confounders, Tejaas predicted 18851 unique trans-eQTLs across 49 tissues from GTEx. They are enriched in open chromatin, enhancers and other regulatory regions. Many overlap with disease-associated SNPs, pointing to tissue-specific transcriptional regulation mechanisms.

Here, we show the importance of embedding prior biological knowledge in the decision rules yielded by ML approaches to build robust classifiers. We tested this by applying different ML algorithms on gene expression data to predict three difficult cancer phenotypes: bladder cancer progression to muscle invasive disease; response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in triple-negative breast cancer, and prostate cancer metastatic progression. We developed two sets of classifiers: <jats:italic>mechanistic</jats:italic>, by restricting the training process to features capturing a specific biological mechanism; and <jats:italic>agnostic</jats:italic>, in which the training didn’t use any <jats:italic>a priori</jats:italic> biological information.

This usually results from the discrepancy between the high number of features compared to the much smaller number of samples used in the training process, which results in the machine learning algorithm perfectly fitting the training data with a subsequent deterioration in performance in independent cohorts. We introduce a mechanistic framework to mitigate overfitting and improve interpretability by constraining the training process to simple rank-based decision rules recapitulating relevant, cancer-related, biological mechanisms. Our approach aims at reducing the number of training variables to a pre-defined set of biologically important features in the form of gene pairs. The classification mechanism depends entirely on the relative ordering of these pairs, making it robust to data preprocessing techniques, improving the overall interpretability of the resulting models with significant translational implications. Most importantly, these pairs are configured in such a way that the decision rules resulting from the genes relative order embed and recapitulate specific biological mechanism, inherently enhancing the classifiers interpretability.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

We identified more than 100,000 significant prognostic biomarkers and demonstrate that these genomic features can predict patient outcomes in clinically-ambiguous situations. While adverse biomarkers are commonly believed to represent cancer driver genes and promising therapeutic targets, we show that cancer features associated with shorter survival times are not enriched for either oncogenes or for successful drug targets. Instead, the strongest adverse biomarkers represent widely-expressed housekeeping genes with roles in cell cycle progression, and, correspondingly, nearly all therapies directed against these features have failed in clinical trials. In total, our analysis establishes a rich resource for prognostic biomarker analysis and clarifies the use of patient survival data in preclinical cancer research and therapeutic development.</jats:p>",

It is essential that they accurately recapitulate the disease state of interest to generate results that will translate in the clinic. Prior studies have demonstrated that preclinical models do not recapitulate all biological aspects of human tissues, particularly with respect to the tissue of origin gene expression signatures. Therefore, it is critical to assess how well preclinical model gene expression profiles correlate with human cancer tissues to inform preclinical model selection and data analysis decisions. Here we evaluated how well preclinical models recapitulate human cancer and non-diseased tissue gene expression patterns<jats:italic>in silico</jats:italic>with respect to the full gene expression profile as well as subsetting by the most variable genes, genes significantly correlated with tumor purity, and tissue-specific genes by using publicly available gene expression profiles across multiple sources. We found that using the full gene set improves correlations between preclinical model and tissue global gene expression profiles, confirmed that GBM PDX global gene expression correlation to GBM tumor global gene expression outperforms GBM cell line to GBM tumor global gene expression correlations, and demonstrated that preclinical models in our study often failed to reproduce tissue-specific expression. While including additional genes for global gene expression comparison between cell lines and tissues decreases the overall correlation, it improves the relative rank between a cell line and its tissue of origin compared to other tissues. Our findings underscore the importance of using the full gene expression set measured when comparing preclinical models and tissues and confirm that tissue-specific patterns are better preserved in GBM PDX models than in GBM cell lines. Future studies can build on these findings to determine the specific pathways and gene sets recapitulated by particular preclinical models to facilitate model selection for a given study design or goal.</jats:p>",

Utilizing the burgeoning single-cell sequencing data, we have pioneered the construction of a foundation model for single-cell biology, scGPT, which is based on generative pre-trained transformer across a repository of over 33 million cells.

Real world data and a simulation study show that the elastic net often outperforms the lasso, while enjoying a similar sparsity of representation. In addition, the elastic net encourages a grouping effect, where strongly correlated predictors tend to be in or out of the model together. The elastic net is particularly useful when the number of predictors (p) is much bigger than the number of observations (n). By contrast, the lasso is not a very satisfactory variable selection method in the p≫n case. An algorithm called LARS-EN is proposed for computing elastic net regularization paths efficiently, much like algorithm LARS does for the lasso.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Recall and precision are often used to evaluate the effectiveness of information retrieval systems. They are easy to define if there is a single query and if the retrieval result generated for the query is a linear ordering. However, when the retrieval results are weakly ordered, in the sense that several documents have an identical retrieval status value with respect to a query, some probabilistic notion of precision has to be introduced. Relevance probability, expected precision, and so forth, are some alternatives mentioned in the literature for this purpose. Furthermore, when many queries are to be evaluated and the retrieval results averaged over these queries, some method of interpolation of precision values at certain preselected recall levels is needed. The currently popular approaches for handling both a weak ordering and interpolation are found to be inconsistent, and the results obtained are not easy to interpret. Moreover, in cases where some alternatives are available, no comparative analysis that would facilitate the selection of a particular strategy has been provided. In this paper, we systematically investigate the various problems and issues associated with the use of recall and precision as measures of retrieval system performance. Our motivation is to provide a comparative analysis of methods available for defining precision in a probabilistic sense and to promote a better understanding of the various issues involved in retrieval performance evaluation.</jats:p>",

Given that more than 60% of non–small cell lung carcinomas (NSCLCs) express EGFR, EGFR has become an important therapeutic target for the treatment of these tumors. Inhibitors that target the kinase domain of EGFR have been developed and are clinically active. More importantly, such tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are especially effective in patients whose tumors harbor activating mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of the EGFR gene. More recent trials have suggested that for advanced NSCLC patients with EGFR mutant tumors, initial therapy with a TKI instead of chemotherapy may be the best choice of treatment. Therefore, mutation testing is mandatory to identify these patients, given that selection based only on clinico-pathologic characteristics is inadequate. We review the role of EGFR mutations in the diagnosis and management of NSCLC. </jats:p>",

All existing data were obtained either using statistical association between gene expression measurements found in primary tumors and clinical outcome, or using experimentally derived signatures from mouse tumor models. Here, we describe a distinct approach that consists of using tissue surgically resected from lung metastatic lesions and comparing their gene expression profiles with those from nonpulmonary sites, all coming from breast cancer patients. We show that the gene expression profiles of organ-specific metastatic lesions can be used to predict lung metastasis in breast cancer. We identified a set of 21 lung metastasis–associated genes. Using a cohort of 72 lymph node–negative breast cancer patients, we developed a 6-gene prognostic classifier that discriminated breast primary cancers with a significantly higher risk of lung metastasis. We then validated the predictive ability of the 6-gene signature in 3 independent cohorts of breast cancers consisting of a total of 721 patients. Finally, we show that the signature improves risk stratification independently of known standard clinical variables and a previously established lung metastasis signature based on an experimental breast cancer metastasis model.

Current opinion suggests that this is because the cell lines and xenografts that are commonly used are inadequate models that do not effectively mimic and predict human responses. This has become such a widespread belief that it approaches dogma in the field of drug discovery and optimization and has spurred a surge in studies devoted to the development of more sophisticated animal models such as orthotopic patient-derived xenografts in an attempt to obtain more accurate estimates of whether particular cancers will respond to given treatments. Here, we explore the evidence that has led to the move away from the use of in vitro cell lines and toward various forms of xenograft models for drug screening and development. We review some of the pros and cons of each model and give an overview of ways in which the use of cell lines could be modified to improve the predictive capacity of this well-defined model.

Here, we report that KMT2 mutations occur frequently in non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and are associated with high mutation loads and poor survival. KMT2C regulated DNA damage responses (DDR) through direct recruitment to DNA damage sites by Ago2 and small noncoding DNA damage response RNA, where it mediates H3K4 methylation, chromatin relaxation, secondary recruitment of DDR factors, and amplification of DDR signals along chromatin. Furthermore, by disrupting homologous recombination (HR)–mediated DNA repair, KMT2C/D mutations sensitized NSCLC to Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors (PARPi), whose efficacy is unclear in NSCLC due to low BRCA1/2 mutation rates. These results demonstrate a novel, transcription-independent role of KMT2C in DDR and identify high-frequency KMT2C/D mutations as much-needed biomarkers for PARPi therapies in NSCLC and other cancers with infrequent BRCA1/2 mutations.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Significance:</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>This study uncovers a critical role for KMT2C in DDR via direct recruitment to DNA damage sites, identifying high-frequency KMT2C/D mutations as biomarkers for response to PARP inhibition in cancer.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>",

This study aimed to build a quantitative readout of RAS pathway activity to (i) uncover molecular surrogates of RAS activity specific to colorectal cancer, (ii) improve the prediction of cetuximab response in patients, and (iii) suggest new treatment strategies.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Experimental Design: A model of RAS pathway activity was trained in a large colorectal cancer dataset and validated in three independent colorectal cancer patient datasets. Novel molecular traits were inferred from The Cancer Genome Atlas colorectal cancer data. The ability of the RAS model to predict resistance to cetuximab was tested in mouse xenografts and three independent patient cohorts. Drug sensitivity correlations between our model and large cell line compendiums were performed.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Results: The performance of the RAS model was remarkably robust across three validation datasets. (i) Our model confirmed the heterogeneity of the RAS phenotype in KRAS wild-type patients, and suggests novel molecular traits driving its phenotype (e.g., MED12 loss, FBXW7 mutation, MAP2K4 mutation). (ii) It improved the prediction of response and progression-free survival (HR, 2.0; P &amp;lt; 0.01) to cetuximab compared with KRAS mutation (xenograft and patient cohorts). (iii) Our model consistently predicted sensitivity to MAP–ERK kinase (MEK) inhibitors (P &amp;lt; 0.01) in two cell panel screens.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Conclusions: Modeling the RAS phenotype in colorectal cancer allows for the robust interrogation of RAS pathway activity across cell lines, xenografts, and patient cohorts.

Deep learning analyses have shown much promise to study disease heterogeneity.

Current normalization procedures such as log of counts per million and feature selection by highly variable genes produce false variability in dimension reduction. We propose simple multinomial methods, including generalized principal component analysis (GLM-PCA) for non-normal distributions, and feature selection using deviance. These methods outperform the current practice in a downstream clustering assessment using ground truth datasets.</jats:p>",

From the TCGA Pan-Cancer Atlas that contains genetic alteration data, we focus on RNA sequencing, DNA methylation arrays, reverse phase protein arrays (RPPA), microRNA, and somatic mutational signatures as -omics readouts. Across a collection of genes recurrently mutated in cancer, RNA sequencing tends to be the most effective predictor of mutation state. We find that one or more other data types for many of the genes are approximately equally effective predictors. Performance is more variable between mutations than that between data types for the same mutation, and there is little difference between the top data types.

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Advancements in sequencing have led to the proliferation of multi-omic profiles of human cells under different conditions and perturbations. In addition, many databases have amassed information about pathways and gene “signatures”—patterns of gene expression associated with specific cellular and phenotypic contexts. An important current challenge in systems biology is to leverage such knowledge about gene coordination to maximize the predictive power and generalization of models applied to high-throughput datasets. However, few such integrative approaches exist that also provide interpretable results quantifying the importance of individual genes and pathways to model accuracy. We introduce AKLIMATE, a first kernel-based stacked learner that seamlessly incorporates multi-omics feature data with prior information in the form of pathways for either regression or classification tasks. AKLIMATE uses a novel multiple-kernel learning framework where individual kernels capture the prediction propensities recorded in random forests, each built from a specific pathway gene set that integrates all omics data for its member genes. AKLIMATE has comparable or improved performance relative to state-of-the-art methods on diverse phenotype learning tasks, including predicting microsatellite instability in endometrial and colorectal cancer, survival in breast cancer, and cell line response to gene knockdowns. We show how AKLIMATE is able to connect feature data across data platforms through their common pathways to identify examples of several known and novel contributors of cancer and synthetic lethality.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>By classifying patients into subgroups, clinicians can provide more effective care than using a uniform approach for all patients. Such subgroups might include patients with a particular disease subtype, patients with a good (or poor) prognosis, or patients most (or least) likely to respond to a particular therapy. Transcriptomic measurements reflect the downstream effects of genomic and epigenomic variations. However, high-throughput technologies generate thousands of measurements per patient, and complex dependencies exist among genes, so it may be infeasible to classify patients using traditional statistical models. Machine-learning classification algorithms can help with this problem. However, hundreds of classification algorithms exist—and most support diverse hyperparameters—so it is difficult for researchers to know which are optimal for gene-expression biomarkers. We performed a benchmark comparison, applying 52 classification algorithms to 50 gene-expression datasets (143 class variables). We evaluated algorithms that represent diverse machine-learning methodologies and have been implemented in general-purpose, open-source, machine-learning libraries. When available, we combined clinical predictors with gene-expression data. Additionally, we evaluated the effects of performing hyperparameter optimization and feature selection using nested cross validation. Kernel- and ensemble-based algorithms consistently outperformed other types of classification algorithms; however, even the top-performing algorithms performed poorly in some cases. Hyperparameter optimization and feature selection typically improved predictive performance, and univariate feature-selection algorithms typically outperformed more sophisticated methods. Together, our findings illustrate that algorithm performance varies considerably when other factors are held constant and thus that algorithm selection is a critical step in biomarker studies.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Those building predictive models from transcriptomic data are faced with two conflicting perspectives. The first, based on the inherent high dimensionality of biological systems, supposes that complex non-linear models such as neural networks will better match complex biological systems. The second, imagining that complex systems will still be well predicted by simple dividing lines prefers linear models that are easier to interpret. We compare multi-layer neural networks and logistic regression across multiple prediction tasks on GTEx and Recount3 datasets and find evidence in favor of both possibilities. We verified the presence of non-linear signal when predicting tissue and metadata sex labels from expression data by removing the predictive linear signal with Limma, and showed the removal ablated the performance of linear methods but not non-linear ones. However, we also found that the presence of non-linear signal was not necessarily sufficient for neural networks to outperform logistic regression. Our results demonstrate that while multi-layer neural networks may be useful for making predictions from gene expression data, including a linear baseline model is critical because while biological systems are high-dimensional, effective dividing lines for predictive models may not be.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Successful treatment decisions in cancer depend on the accurate assessment of patient risk. To improve our understanding of the molecular alterations that underlie deadly malignancies, we analyzed the genomic profiles of 17,879 tumors from patients with known outcomes. We find that mutations in almost all cancer driver genes contain remarkably little information on patient prognosis. However, CNAs in these same driver genes harbor significant prognostic power. Focal CNAs are associated with worse outcomes than broad alterations, and CNAs in many driver genes remain prognostic when controlling for stage, grade, TP53 status, and total aneuploidy. By performing a meta-analysis across independent patient cohorts, we identify robust prognostic biomarkers in specific cancer types, and we demonstrate that a subset of these alterations also confer specific therapeutic vulnerabilities. In total, our analysis establishes a comprehensive resource for cancer biomarker identification and underscores the importance of gene copy number profiling in assessing clinical risk.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>To detect functional somatic mutations in tumor samples, whole-exome sequencing (WES) is often used for its reliability and relative low cost. RNA-seq, while generally used to measure gene expression, can potentially also be used for identification of somatic mutations. However there has been little systematic evaluation of the utility of RNA-seq for identifying somatic mutations. Here, we develop and evaluate a pipeline for processing RNA-seq data from glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) tumors in order to identify somatic mutations. The pipeline entails the use of the STAR aligner 2-pass procedure jointly with MuTect2 from genome analysis toolkit (GATK) to detect somatic variants. Variants identified from RNA-seq data were evaluated by comparison against the COSMIC and dbSNP databases, and also compared to somatic variants identified by exome sequencing. We also estimated the putative functional impact of coding variants in the most frequently mutated genes in GBM. Interestingly, variants identified by RNA-seq alone showed better representation of GBM-related mutations cataloged by COSMIC. RNA-seq-only data substantially outperformed the ability of WES to reveal potentially new somatic mutations in known GBM-related pathways, and allowed us to build a high-quality set of somatic mutations common to exome and RNA-seq calls. Using RNA-seq data in parallel with WES data to detect somatic mutations in cancer genomes can thus broaden the scope of discoveries and lend additional support to somatic variants identified by exome sequencing alone.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "There is an increasing realization that algorithmic inductive biases are central in preventing overfitting; empirically, we often see a benign overfitting phenomenon in overparameterized settings for natural learning algorithms, such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD), where little to no explicit regularization has been employed. This work considers this issue in arguably the most basic setting: constant-stepsize SGD (with iterate averaging) for linear regression in the overparameterized regime. Our main result provides a sharp excess risk bound, stated in terms of the full eigenspectrum of the data covariance matrix, that reveals a bias-variance decomposition characterizing when generalization is possible: (i) the variance bound is characterized in terms of an effective dimension and (ii) the bias bound provides a sharp geometric characterization in terms of the location of the initial iterate (and how it aligns with the data covariance matrix). We reflect on a number of notable differences between the algorithmic regularization afforded by (unregularized) SGD in comparison to ordinary least squares (minimum-norm interpolation) and ridge regression.",

These can be generalized by replacing each binary unit by an infinite number of copies that all have the same weights but have progressively more negative biases. The learning and inference rules for these \"Stepped Sigmoid Units\" are unchanged. They can be approximated efficiently by noisy, rectified linear units. Compared with binary units, these units learn features that are better for object recognition on the NORB dataset and face verification on the Labeled Faces in the Wild dataset. Unlike binary units, rectified linear units preserve information about relative intensities as information travels through multiple layers of feature detectors.",
